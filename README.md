## Chassis for Camera Signal Routing  

**Centralized module frame to route and manage multiple video inputs/outputs.**  
- Supports up to 18 VersiVision video/data modules, enabling complex signal routing. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Hot-swappable module bays ensure you can replace or reconfigure routing without shutting down. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- LED status indicators provide instant visual feedback about each module’s health. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Redundant power supply design helps preserve signal continuity in case of power failure. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Industrial Video Chassis  

**Built for demanding, always-on video environments in industrial settings.**  
- Wide operating temperature range, high MTBF (> 100,000 hours) for reliable 24/7 operation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Dual auto-switching 110/220 VAC power supplies for redundancy and voltage flexibility. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Internal air‑cooling fans to maintain stable thermal conditions under load. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Compatible with Versitron video-to-fiber converters and HD video modules, making it ideal for industrial fiber-based video networks. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
